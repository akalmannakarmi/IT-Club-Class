Read all instruction and their hex values  

Organize the instruction in terms of size 

search for the instruction in the values
use the value to get its hex value
if it has more data to add - add it to next addresses

keep track of current instuction addresses 
and increment for next data

save named addresses to replace when needed

write the result to a file

Program Flow
1) Read 1 byte instructions
2) Read 2 byte instructions
3) Read 3 byte instructions N jump instructions
4) Find the given instruction in our instructions lists
5) If its 1 byte instruction add corresponding hex code
6) If its 2 byte instruction add corresponding hex code and the 1byte data to next address
7) If its 3 byte instruction add corresponding hex code and the 2 byte data to next addresses
8) Skip jump address and leave them with the name
9) Save named addresses in a dictionary
10) After all instructions replace names in result with their address
11) Write the result to file
